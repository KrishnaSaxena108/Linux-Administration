# 🧪 Experiment : 15 - 16

## 📌 Objective

Learn to:

- Write shell scripts to print system information.
- Write shell scripts to perform basic mathematical calculations.
- Use redirection operators to store output.

---

## 🚀 Tasks

### 1️⃣ Shell Script: Print System Information

#### 📄 Script: `system_info.sh`

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Script to display system information

echo "----- SYSTEM INFORMATION -----"
echo "Hostname: $(hostname)"
echo "Operating System: $(uname -o)"
echo "Kernel Version: $(uname -r)"
echo "CPU Architecture: $(uname -m)"
echo "Current User: $(whoami)"
```

### ➡️ Command to Run:

```bash
# For output redirection
bash system_info.sh > system_info_output.txt
# For printing the output
cat system_info_output.txt
```

### 2️⃣ Shell Script: Basic Mathematical Calculations

### 📄 Script: `basic_calc.sh`

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Script to perform basic calculations

num1=10
num2=5

echo "Addition: $((num1 + num2))"
echo "Subtraction: $((num1 - num2))"
echo "Multiplication: $((num1 * num2))"
echo "Division: $((num1 / num2))"
```

### ➡️ Command to Run:

```bash
# For output redirection
bash basic_calc.sh > calc_output.txt
# For printing the output
cat calc_output.txt
```

### 3️⃣ Usage of Redirection Operators

| Operator | Function                                   |
|---------|--------------------------------------------|
| `>`     | Redirects output to a file (overwrite)      |
| `>>`    | Appends output to a file                    |
| `2>`    | Redirects standard error to a file          |
| `&>`    | Redirects both output and error to a file   |

---

### 🎯 Summary

- Created shell scripts to display system information and perform calculations.
- Used redirection operators to save the script outputs in text files.
