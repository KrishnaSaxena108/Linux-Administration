# 🧪 Experiment : 13 - 14

## 📌 Objective

Understand how to effectively manage **file ownership** and **permissions** using `chown` and `chmod` commands along with their useful options.

---

## 📝 Description

In Linux system administration, file security is managed by setting appropriate ownership and permissions. This experiment covers:

- Changing file owner and group using `chown`.
- Modifying file permissions using `chmod` (symbolic and numeric).
- Exploring important command options.
- Verifying the applied changes.

---

## 🚀 Tasks

### 1️⃣ Using `chown` Command

Change the ownership and group of files/directories.

### 🔧 Commands for `chown`

```bash
# Step 1: Create a sample file
touch sample.txt

# Step 2: Change owner to 'user1'
sudo chown user1 sample.txt

# Step 3: Change owner and group
sudo chown user1:group1 sample.txt

# Step 4: Change ownership recursively (for directories)
sudo chown -R user1:group1 my_directory/

# Step 5: Suppress error messages (useful if some files can't be changed)
sudo chown -f user1 sample.txt

# Step 6: Verbose output to see what's being changed
sudo chown -v user1:group1 sample.txt

# Step 7: Verify ownership change
ls -l sample.txt
```

### 🔑 Common `chown` Options

| Option        | Description                                  |
|--------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `-R`         | Recursively change ownership in directories  |
| `-v`         | Display verbose output                       |
| `-f`         | Suppress error messages                      |
| `--reference`| Use ownership from another reference file    |

---

### 2️⃣ Using `chmod` Command
Modify file/directory permissions.

### 🔧 Commands for `chmod`

```bash
# Step 1: Change permissions using symbolic method
chmod u+rwx,g+rx,o-r sample.txt

# Step 2: Change permissions using numeric method
chmod 750 sample.txt

# Step 3: Apply permissions recursively
chmod -R 755 my_directory/

# Step 4: Verbose output for each change
chmod -v 700 sample.txt

# Step 5: Suppress errors
chmod -f 644 sample.txt

# Step 6: Verify permissions
ls -l sample.txt
```

### 🔑 Common `chmod` Options

| Option        | Description                                  |
|--------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `-R`         | Apply permissions recursively in directories |
| `-v`         | Verbose output showing each file change      |
| `-f`         | Suppress error messages                      |
| `--reference`| Copy permissions from another file           |

### 🎯 Summary

- Used `chown` to change file owner and group (with options: `-R`, `-v`, `-f`).
- Used `chmod` to set file permissions using both **symbolic** and **numeric** methods (with options: `-R`, `-v`, `-f`).
- Verified all changes with `ls -l` command.
